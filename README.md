# TclIdentityServerREST
A Tcl implementation of an IdentityServer OAuth 2.0 client and a REST Service Wrapper

This was created for a Hackathon at my work. It only has very limited implementation, but it should be a good guide on how to implement your own services.

If I revisit this project, the roadmap is something like this...
1. Add capability to use the refresh token.
2. Add ability to parse discovery document to get endpoints.
3. Add more overloads / support to wrapper methods for REST operations.
4. Proper error handling.
